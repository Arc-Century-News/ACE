# The peaceful like of the Morse Family

Just south of the Hamelin Town a household that calls itselg the Morse has settle at the end of the Rift. Luckely, we got granted access to their town and we were able to see and take pictures of their amazing, advanced city. The Morse people are very organized workaholics, stopping only to eat one of the many yum foods and talking as little as possible.

Even if they wanted to spare some of their precious time and talk to us, they couldn't understand out language. We learned bits and peaces of their tongue by spending some years with them. We met a very nice but hardworking carrot farmer, Princess Morse.

**The Peace Note**

While living with them, we found a note, lying on the ground between some berry bushes. _I came to make peace witht this fam_, it said. We don't know if that person managed to make peace with this clan, what happened to him and grom which famimy he or she came from. We tried to fulfull that notes last wish but no elder could understand our plea for peace.
