If you follow the road heading north west from the Pasillico Town, it will lead you to the middle of our world, where the Tarr monument lies, there, other road branches will lead you to unknown places. Following one road, we met a man called Mars Jones, who was exploring as well. Together, we found an abandoned city, filled with food, dogs and a note saying: "_Enjoy life - have friends. It makes life easy._"

Where do these other roads lead? Who was the person who built these incredible constructions. Was he or she alone? If you have any information about the whereabout of this person, please contact @Tea or @Emma on discord. We will be very happy to talk to this person.

Are we going to see more roads, connecting each town, and making a peaceful trade between them possible? Maybe some one will start making signs to indicate where every road leads? 

We will see what this Arc will hold for us in the future.
