Today, our reporters set out to find all the different families and try to document their townlayouts and the important events in their towns.

* # The Carrow Family

The Carrows were settled in a decent spot and had already set up an engine, providing them with enough water to tend their organized berry farm. Their big stash of iron could easily support them for the next hundreds of years to come and the boxes of the bakery were filled with pies. Our reporters were able to witness an important event, a peace declaration between the Gomez and Carrow Family. Life seemed great. But it wouldn't be OHOL if there was not trouble knocking on the gate. Some reports say that triplets, riding on horses filled with bowls of pads, were trying to force an early end to this family. Luckily, a brave citizen under the name of Pearl Carrow could defend her town with the help of other brave members of the family.

* # The Gomez Family

Not far from the Carrow Family, Gomez had created their own little heaven on earth. Engine, Iron, Pies, Stew, they had it all. Except for an oven. Unfortunately, someone had transformed the oven into a forge and all the uncooked pies looked really sad next to it. People started to gather around this catastrophe, arguing and yelling. But it wasn't something a pickaxe and a new adobe couldn't fix that problem. The oven was back in business and all was good again.

* # The Hammer Family

Travelling towards the western rift, our reporters found what they thought to be an abandoned town but a lonely man under the name of Chad Hammer opened the towns gate and gave them a private tour around his town. He told us in his interview that he was the last surviving Hammer and was hoping for someone to come by and revive his home. He already prepared backpacks in case some people would want to settle in. It is said that some members of the Gomez Family ade it their new home.

* # The Kelderman Family

According to the last Hammer, there used to live two families in his town : the Hammers and the Keldermans. They lived in peace with each other but that didn't stop some tensions between the two different clans. After a young Kelderman girl was knifed, some young members started to migrate to another town, south-east of the rift. After some time, our family finally managed to find the remaining Keldermans, trying to get settled in in their new home.

* # The Lola Family

Our reporters had to travel for a long time to finally find the Lola household. The Lolas seemed to be a meat loving family, having a fair amount of different pies, cooked mutton, turkey and bread. They even had the first Pig Pen of this Arc Century ! An engine couldn't be found in the berry farm, so it might have broken and needed to be fixed.
