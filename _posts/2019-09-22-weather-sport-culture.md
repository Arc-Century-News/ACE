* # weather

Prepare warm clothes, because temperatures in the next three days will be between blue, red, with a chance of apocalypse. Don't forget about sunglasses, because the sun won't set very soon. Our scientist will talk more about this event in next news post, so stay tuned.

* # sport
Sports aren't very popular in OHOL, because most people don't like stop working, but this workaholic behaviors can lead to occupational burnout. But you don't need worry about it anymore, because our scientists just discovered sport that need only wooden disc and two, or more players. It is called frisbee!

* # culture
Culture is heavily overlooked thing in OHOL, and we decided to change that. We want to support literature and cultural places like cinemas, theatres, dance parties and casinos, but we need your help. It doesn't matter if you can't participate in it, or you just don't want participate. We need you to stop ruining this place by stop stealing baskets from library, stop stealing popcorn from cinemas, stop stealing costumes from theatres, letting them to dance and by stop stealing bowls from casinos. Thanks for understanding.
