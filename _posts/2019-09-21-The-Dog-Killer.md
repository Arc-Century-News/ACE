In the Posillico Family, People were mourning. Their beloved Shepard Jackie died to a broken heart. Everyone was sad of her passing except for one person.

Let us explain what exactly happened. 

Joshawan Posillico biggest wish was to have a dog. His wish came true and he name his new Shepard Jackie. Everyone loved Jackie. She was a very sweet, loving and active puppy and grew to a wonderful dog. When Jackie had her first litter of puppies, the town was exited and happy for her. 

Everyone, but Juniper Posillico. She took away Jackies puppies and left them to die in the wilderness. When the citizens of this town noticed a crying Jackie and her missing puppies, a search was organized. Two little pups were found, famished but still alive! For the third one it was already too late. 

Joshawan, filled with rage and sadness, killed the known villain of this horrible act by Bow and Arrow. Juniper's mother cried and begged the town to curse and punish the murderer of her beloved girl. But everyone agreed and supported Joshawan in his act, so she was the only one mourning the death of the cold hearted Juniper Posillico.

Later on, the body of Jackie was found. She had been looking for her last puppy, but when she couldn't be reunited with her family, she died to a broken heart. 

Rest in peace Jackie.
