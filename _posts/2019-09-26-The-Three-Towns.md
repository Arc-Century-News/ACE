We write the year 3400 and the two remaining families are Nana and Banas, scattered everywhere around the Rift. During those years, people have gathered together to build amazing structures, walls surrounding and protecting the town, bakeries filled with pies and different monuments. 

One of those towns is situated far north at the eastern rift. It was founded by Eve Hammer and with the help of her kids, managed to build the first structures of the town. Sadly, the Hammers died out at Generation 18 and different families took over and continued to expand.

Now, some members of the Nana household live there. The most astounding building would be the enormous bakery, north of the pen.

Following the path south, one will soon find the Bell Tower Town. Build in the wall of the bakery, it has become the center of the city, attracting citizens all around the Rift.

The bakery and the pen are build next to each other, connected by tracks and supplying the bakery with fresh mutton. Above it, a little garden had been started, surrounded by stone walls. In the middle, a pine tree had been planted and decorated with christmas lights.

Next to the forge, one can find the church, a place where Queens and Kings pass on their crowns, where important decisions were made and trials arranged. Sadly, a curse lyes upon this beautiful town. Blood was spilled and many females struggled with infertility, which led this town to be abandoned more than once.

South of the eastern Rift, another city surrounded by massive stone walls. Eve Kelderman and two others, Eve Hammer and an unknown Eve, layed the first berry farm and the basics of an early camp. With time, Kelderman took over the settlement and ruled there for 25 generations and were killed by some members of the Banas.

Now, some members of the Nana household occupy this city, talking to their northern neighbour through the radio. Next to the radio station, a graveyard has been built to honor their fallen family members.

West of the old Kelderman Town, the Banas have settled in a decent town, surrounded and protected by stone walls. Their cosy little bakery makes enough pies for the towns citizens, stocked in the storage room.
