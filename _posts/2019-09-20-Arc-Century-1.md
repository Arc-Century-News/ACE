Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders. Another Arc Century has ended, lasting roughly 1700 years. What a Century! In the beginning, the Keldermans started off as the strongest family, counting almost 12 females. But, according to some recourses, the lack of fertility in a generation caused the downfall of that family. The last remaining Keldermans opened their gates to the Morsell family, who quickly settled in. After the disappearance of Keldermans, a family called Nim grew stronger and stronger. But at the last moment of the Eve Window, Eve Hammer managed to slip in and organize a strong and growing family. For some years, the Hammers dominated the Arc. Some rumors say that slavery was being introduced in that family, which could be the cause of the abruptly ending of the Hammers in Generation 36. Morsell and Nim were now the only surviving families, racing each other to be the last surviving dynasty. 

During that time, we have seen Kings and Queens come and go but peace always remained between those clans. It seems like this Arc could have lasted for a while. Gardens were built, constructions of belltowers were started and a bird was singing.

Unfortunately, a civil war in the Morsell family broke out at Generation 57 and was the cause of its downfall, leaving the Nim family as the last survivor at Generation 76 ! It was indeed a very eventful Arc! Which Family will become the dominant one in this next dynasty and will lay the first berry farm for a greater future? It has been a great century and we wish you all the best of luck. Your reporters Tea and Emma
