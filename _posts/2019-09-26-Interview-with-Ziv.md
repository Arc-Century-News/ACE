Ziv started to play this game 4 months ago and was enjoying the game mechanics with some of his friends. But when a group of people betrayed his hospitality, killed him and took over his town, he started to change his way of playing and thinking about this game. 

At first, he wanted to take revenge on those who killed and cursed him unfairly but with time, his motivation and methods changed. 

One good example of his play style is a incident during Arc 2, when a new griefing style appeared. In the Hamelin Family, a citizen started to throw tools, recourses and pies over the rift, never to be retreated again. Ziv managed to confront and kill this player but instead of praising and thanking him, the town stabbed and cursed him.

Disappointed and furious, he managed to come back to the town and kill those who cursed and killed him. This is one of the reasons why he kills players. He doesn't have a specific strategy on how to kill, since, according to him, you can just go in, kill some and come back again when you get killed.
When it comes to killing off Eves, his motivation is another. In his opinion, the Eve Spiral, after the Rift Update, is broken: Eves are spawning way too close to each other since the Rift is too small for such a number of different families during the early stage of the Arc. Weapons, especially Bow and Arrow, are easily crafted and don't require any skills to kill a defenseless Eve, who doesn't have the recourses to heal an early attack. Eve Kill is known to run around the map with a bow and arrow, specializing in killing the Eves and their girls of an early camp. He sometimes twins with that particular Eve during the Eve Window. When asked if he and Eve Kill were playing under the names of Eve Bow and Eve Arrow, he told us that he will neither deny or confirm it.

Cursing, according to him, doesn't really matter in this stage of the game. If one is cursed during the Eve Window by several people, they can still get reborn as Eves and hunt down the families, a trip that doesn't take too long, since the Rift isn't that big. If they are cursed by one family, they can still get reborn to it, the only thing they need is one fertile woman gathering for example iron outside of town.
When asking about multi culture camps and his opinion about them, he told us that he would love to have more of them around but the reality is, that they will not work. Even if those families live in peace together, a small group with knifes or bow and arrows can still end the line. 

To the question about wether or not he would grief and hide materials, he answered that there are two reasons when he does that kind of griefing.

    1) When he wants to get Jason's and people's attention on a specific problem or flaw in the game, he will start griefing them until the cry for help and annoyance will get heard by Jason.

    2) When an Arc has lasted too long and no natural recourses can be gathered,he will start to hide tools or materials to force people to kill one of the two families in order to reset the Arc.

We asked him if he thinks that his actions will impact new players trying to get into the game and he said that they will have to learn what the current situation of the game is. But, when he gets a notification that one of his babies is actually a new player, he will try and teach them some things. He last showed one how to make compost. 

He cares about what people think about him on the big discord but when asked to stop griefing, he prefers to stick with it so people will learn how to prevent or counter it. He told us that he once forged, with the iron of an abandoned town, a slot box full of knifes and placed them next to the oven, curious what people would do. Would they either use them on each other or recycle the iron for much more needed tools?

Talking to him and hearing about his motivations, reasoning and thinking behind his actions, made this interview very interesting. We must keep in mind that there were many others who griefed before him and that they too may have their reasons for doing so. Some enjoy the killing aspects of the game, some might just want to be a pain in the ass to other or some want to point out and highlight the current flaws and problems of the game. 

We thank Ziv for his time and for explaining why he does what he does.
