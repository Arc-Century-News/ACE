Carts are very useful, especially if they are attached to a horse. One can get many things done and can bring back recourses from outside the town faster with a horse than by foot. But our horses are striking. They refuse to move a muscle as soon as they have to carry anything more than the rider. 

The Posillico Boys, Will and Quenton, have already started to pray to our lord Jason, to persuade our animals to do their job correctly. They are strong believers in his power. Others just purpose to give them more than just one carrot to eat. 

For now, we have to rely on our own strength to gather all of our materials.
