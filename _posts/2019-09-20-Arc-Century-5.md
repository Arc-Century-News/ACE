Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders, another Arc Century has found its end, lasting for 860 years.

Countless Eves have set out to find the perfect place to plant the first berry bush for a brighter future. But not all of them could raise a strong enough family to survive the harsh conditions of this world. Those who did, still had to face and survive different threats such as famines, infertility and droughts. 

In the early stages of the Arc, the Torres clan was the strongest one, counting up to 9 females. Even though they took over the town of the Banas, they still payed respect to the grave of that clan's Eve. Some of their clan members were living in peace with the Heart family who later on made peace with the last surviving Nice family. The two families, Torres and Heart, lived at the north-eastern Rift and some of their ancestors had started the construction of a great stone wall.

Disney, Royal, Bana and Nice, years by years those names were merely a faint memory of the past. Until there was only the Aaberg Family and the Torres Family left. 

Torres started off with a healthy amount of females while Aaberg would count less than a handful of fertile females in their families. But these numbers would take an intense turn when after a civil war the Torres had only one female left, while Aaberg had at least 23. The efforts of the Torres Brothers to keep their sister and her offspring alive was in vain. The damages to their town was too severe and the drought problem eventually let to a famine that caused the end of this line.

The Aabergs were the last family that would hear the sound of the well-known bell, announcing the end of another Arc. Another powerful family who would see the end of an old Arc Century and the start of a new one.

We write the Year 176 Arc 6 and another countless Eve have already started their new home. Will we see the end of this Arc soon enough ? Or will these new formed clans be more tougher and will brave all the challenges.

Happy Eveing everyone !
