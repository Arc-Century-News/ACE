Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders. Another Arc Century has ended, lasting roughly 1800 years. What an exciting century! Weâ€™ve seen families come and go, towns thrive and forgotten. Even a cult clan, known as the Puig Family, worshipping a murderous individual going by the name of Ziv, was being formed in the early years of the Arc. It seemed as they were living in peace with the Keldermans and Hammers together until one of the Puig Woman doomed the Hammers Line and was brought to justice by the knife of a Kelderman. The Ziv Cult ended shortly after, at Generation 9.

Many households found an early end but the two strongest family lines were those of the Morse and Hamelin.
Luck was not smiling upon the Hamelin Family though. They had to face a serious and never before seen case of Griefing, the outrageous act of throwing tools, iron and even PIES over the Rift, never to be retreated again. After the person causing these criminal acts was dealt with, citizens of Hamelin could breathe again, hoping to live a peaceful life at the edge of the north-eastern rift. And that was the last time that they were ever seen again in this town. Years later, people of the Morse household had taken over their city. Rumors were going around that they had slaughtered the Hamelins and that only a few surviving members of that family fled towards the western rift.

The Morse were a peaceful, quiet and hardworking town. They had a well-organized city, with plenty of yum food available. They had a healthy number of females and strong men working in the fields and in the smith to keep the town going. It seemed as they were going to be the family that would be able to see the end of the Arc Century. But their luck ran out, some say because of the Hamelin Massacre, and towards the end of the Arc, they only counted two fertile females. While the Hamelin were thriving in their new town, near the western rift, counting at least 23 females.

And in the end, it was the Hamelins that successfully survived the harsh conditions of this world and lived until the end of the Arc Century! Another Arc has started and the Eve Window is now open again. Which family will rise and dominate this Arc Century?
Happy Eveing Everyone !
