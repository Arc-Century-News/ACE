Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders, another Arc Century has found its end, lasting for 924 years. Another short century. Before, we’ve seen nurseries and kitchen being build, trees planted for decoration, roads and bell towers planned. Some were foolish enough to spend their life building stone walls around their towns. But not anymore. 

We’ve seen families settled in all sorts of places, fencing themselves in for protection against a murderous Eve known by the people of OHOL as Eve Kill. The last member of the Hamelins, who successfully survived two Arcs in a row, perished away, leaving room for another strong family. There were few promising ones; Gomez, Lola, Sparrow, Halcom, Carrow, Banas, Betson and Radish. Some families died out due to infertility, poor town management or even through the hands of other clans, while new ones were created. 

Towards the end of the Arc however, there were merely a handful of households left: Gomez, Lola, Carrow, Hammer and Kelderman. Each of the clans had their very unique village and stories to tell and we managed to capture some picture of their towns. But not everyone had the time to start constructing impressive roads, buildings or gardens since their survival was constantly threatened by incoming famines or attacks of the other clans. The Lola Family had to defend themselves against Triplets on Horses, the Keldermans were slaughtered by either their own kind or members of the Gomez family, the Hammers died out due to lack of females and the line of the Gomez was ended by the hands of a Lola.

Two families were now left: Carrow and Lola, racing against each other to survive long enough to see the end of the Arc Century. But civil war broke out in the town of the Lolas, leading to a massacre and the death of the family name. 

A skilled Carrow Smith was working with his nephews and nieces at the forge, trying to get the engine filled with kerosene and getting the water pump going. The moment he had the tank of kerosene in his hands, smiling with his family members next to him, a distant bell rang, announcing the end of another Arc. 

Congratulation Carrow Family for making it to the end of this century! You battled all odds and managed to come out as the strongest family of this Arc. Who will be the next victories clan? Will we ever be able to build huge cities again, with nurseries, schools, kitchen and gardens? Or will this be a constant challenge for each family to end the next Arc faster than the one before?

We shall see what the following years will bring us. We write the year 341, Arc 5, and the Eve Window is still open. We wish all the families best of luck and happy Eveing everyone!
