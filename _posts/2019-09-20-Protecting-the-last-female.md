Dear OHOL Citizens. A civil war broke out in the Torres clan, almost killing off every single one of it's member, causing a nearly early end of another Arc Century, if it wasn't for one last girl.

Alan Torres was born during a period of drought in the Torres Town. The well was dry and the berry farm was dying, people started to stress out, yell at each other and were panicking. Some people started to stab each other but the remaining members managed to keep a clear head and tried to figure out a solution to their situation. But when a boy under the name of Dan Torres started to stab a girl, shit hit the fan. The situation escalated from that moment on quickly and some members of that family started to hunt down all the females until there was only two females left.

They managed to defend themselves from their attacker and killed off those who wanted to see them dead. Bloody corpses were laying all around, the smell of death was still in the air when Alexa Torres was born into this chaos. Together with his mother, sister and two brothers they tried to clean up and rebuild what was left of the town. When suddenly a cry was heard. It was his mother, Felicia Torres, who had an arrow in the abdominal, shot by her very own daughter, Alicea Torres. Out of grief and anger, Alan knifed his sister, just to realise too late that he had doomed his line. That's when his mother gave birth to a baby girl just before passing away! The last female of the Torres clan. The two boys ruched over to her, picked her up and fed her a berry while their brother had to calm down from the shock. They knew what they had to do. Protect their little sister at all cost! 

Years passed by and the two oldest brothers, Alan and Alexa Torres, had to protect their little sister from attacks of the other family. Their knifes were constantly drained in blood and the town still had to solve the water problem. But their sister started to have offsprings of her own, giving the once ghostlike town new life. It seemed as if the Torres could get back on their feet and that the Arc would last a bit longer.

But life is cruel in OHOL and the drought took a toll on this family, leading to a famine that none of the Torres Family survived. An so, the bell rang, ending another Arc.
