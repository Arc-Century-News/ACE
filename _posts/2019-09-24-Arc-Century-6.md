Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders, another Arc has ended, lasting 2981 years!

Two families quickly rose to the top, the Jones and the Posillicos, and even though the older generations declared peace between those two clans, the younger generations were constantly fighting. While the Posillico Family were thriving and counted at one point up to 30 females, the Jones were struggling to survive. Posillico had taken over their towns more than once and those who stayed to live with them, were living in a constant fear of getting stabbed by their angry and blood driven neighbour.

After a serious drought period has finally passed, conflicts between the two clans were still ongoing and the peace between them was now a past memory. And so, war has been declared.

With the years passing by, pleads for an end to the arc have started ramping up and some citizens were starting to hunt down the Jones. Members of the Posillico Family and even members of the Jones were trying to end this family line.
But this family was strong enough to overcome and survive these attacks and started to rebuild some towns to make them their new homes. With time, conflicts and disagreement were slowly fading away, making space for peace between the two households. Buildings were built, yum chains were expanded and the construction of a bell tower was started in a Posillico town.

During this time of peace, the Jones didnâ€™t sit idle in their town and hoped for a peaceful life. No, they prepared. The once weak family, dominated and hunted by the strong and powerful Posillico clan, had become strong enough to initiate one but impressive attack against the other family, ending their line and this Arc.

It was the Jones, who in the beginning had to suffer many setbacks and difficulties,who was thought to be the one who would die out but who, in the end, was the one who heard a distant bell rang while standing over the corpses of a once powerful and feared family.


Another Arc has started, another Eve widow is open. Which Eve will raise a new strong family able to survive until the end?
Happy Eveing everyone.
