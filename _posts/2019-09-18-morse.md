Just south of the Hamelin Town a household that calls itself the Morse has settled at the end of the Rift. Luckely. We were granted access to their town, and were able to take pictures of their amazing, advanced city. The Morse people are very organized workaholics, stopping only to eat one of the many yum foods in short vicitnity and talking as little as possible. ![image](/ace/images/the_Morse_Family.jpg)

Even if they wanted to spare some of their precious time and talk to us, they couldn't understand our language. We learned bits and pieces of their tongue by spending some of our time with them. We met a very nice but hardworking carrot farmer, Princess Morse.

**The Peace Note**

While living with them, we found a note, lying on the ground between some berry bushes. _I came to make peace witht this fam_, it said. We don't know if he managed to make peace with that clan, or what happened to him. We tried to fulfill the notes last wish but no elder could understand our plea for peace. ![image](/ace/images/peace_note_at_morse.jpg)
