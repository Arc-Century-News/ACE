Ladies and Gentlemen, People of OHOL, Young and Elders, another Arc Century has ended, this time lasting only 817 years! What was the cause of this short Arc Period?

It seemed as if the remaining Hamelin members, who survived the Apocalypse, gathered all their strengths and willpower to become yet again the strongest family of this Arc. No other family could keep up with their speed and so were crushed by their infinite power.

Unfortunately, no pictures could have been taken of this Arc, since our departure couldn't finish a new camera in time before the apocalypse happened, announcing the end of another century.

The Hamelin Clan has now become the winner of two Arc Centuries and is known as the strongest family! Can someone challenge them and push them off their new throne ? Will this Arc Century last longer or will we see the end sooner than expected ? We wish everyone good luck !
